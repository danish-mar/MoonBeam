## MoonBeam - Reverse Proxy Server


This README documents the setup and operation of MoonBeam Reverse Proxy Server, meticulously designed for efficient and engaging handling of incoming requests.  üíñ

**Features:**

* **Cute & Organized Code:**  Clean and well-commented Python code ensures easy understanding and maintenance.  
* **Dynamic Configuration:** Loads configurations from `proxy_config.json` for flexible adjustments without recompiling. 
* **SSL Support:**  Securely handles encrypted connections using SSL/TLS.  üõ°Ô∏è
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes error logging and handling to prevent unexpected crashes.
* **Threading for Performance:** Handles multiple clients concurrently, providing excellent performance. 
* **Load Balancing (Enhanced):** Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers for optimal performance.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   pip install pyOpenSSL  # For SSL support
   ```

2. **Configuration:**
   - Create a `proxy_config.json` file with your configuration.  Example:

```json
{
  "backend_servers": [
    "backend1:8080",
    "backend2:8080"
  ],
  "ssl": {
    "cert_file": "path/to/your/certificate.pem",  
    "key_file": "path/to/your/private_key.pem"
  }
}
```
   - **Crucial:** Replace placeholders with *your* actual backend server addresses and certificate/key paths.  You'll need an SSL certificate and key for proper HTTPS functionality.

3. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py 
   ```

This will start the proxy server listening on port 443.

**Key Improvements & Explanations:**

* **Load Balancing:** The server now dynamically distributes incoming requests to different backend servers, ensuring better load distribution and fault tolerance. This is implemented through a sophisticated load balancing mechanism.
* **SSL Support:**  The code now correctly handles SSL/TLS to provide secure connections. Ensure your `proxy_config.json` contains valid SSL certificate and key paths.  
* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging (using `logging`) is implemented for better troubleshooting.  The server will gracefully handle connection issues or forwarding errors.  
* **Modularity:** The codebase is organized into logical classes for easier maintenance and future expansion.  This improves the organization and readability of the code.


**How to Use:**

Your clients (web browsers, etc.) can connect to the proxy server on port 443 using HTTPS. The proxy will forward their requests to the appropriate backend servers specified in `proxy_config.json`.


**Troubleshooting:**

* **Error Messages:** Check the server's log file for any error messages.  They provide crucial clues to resolve issues.
* **Configuration Errors:** Verify your `proxy_config.json` file for correct paths and valid server addresses.
* **SSL Issues:** Ensure you have valid SSL certificates and keys.
